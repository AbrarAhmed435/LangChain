Prove mathematically that line joining midpoint of two sides of triangle is parallel to third side</s>
<|assistant|>
Let ABC be a triangle with midpoints M, N of sides BC and CA, respectively. To prove that the line joining M and N is parallel to the side AB, we need to show that the slopes of the lines joining M and A, and N and B are equal, which implies that the lines are parallel.

Let's find the coordinates of M and N. Since M is the midpoint of BC, we have:

M = (1/2)B + (1/2)C

Similarly, since N is the midpoint of CA, we have:

N = (1/2)A + (1/2)C

Now, let's find the slopes of the lines joining M and A, and N and B.

The slope of the line joining M and A is:

m_{MA} = (y_A - y_M) / (x_A - x_M)

Substituting the coordinates of M and A, we get:

m_{MA} = (y_C - y_B) / (x_C - x_B) - (y_C - y_B) / (2x_B - 2x_C)

Simplifying, we have:

m_{MA} = -m_{BC}

Similarly, the slope of the line joining N and B is:

m_{NB} = -m_{CA}

Since the midpoints of two parallel sides have the same distance from the opposite side, we know that BC and NB are parallel, and similarly, AB and MA are parallel. Therefore, the slopes of the lines joining M and A, and N and B are equal, which implies that the lines are parallel.

Hence, the line joining the midpoints of any two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side.

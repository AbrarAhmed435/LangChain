Prove mathematically that line joining midpoint of two sides of triangle is parallel to third side</s>
<|assistant|>
Let ABC be a triangle with midpoints M, N of sides BC and CA, respectively. We want to prove that the line joining M and N is parallel to the side AB.

Let us draw the perpendicular bisectors of sides BC and CA, which meet at the point O. Since O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors, it is the orthocenter of the triangle ABC.

Now, we know that the midpoints of the sides of a triangle lie on its medians, which are the lines joining the vertices to the midpoint of the opposite side. In our case, the medians of the triangle are MO, NO, and OB. Since M, N, and O are collinear, the medians MO and NO intersect at the point O.

Let us draw the line PQ, which is parallel to the side AB and passes through the point O. We want to prove that the line MN is also parallel to PQ.

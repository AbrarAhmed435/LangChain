Prove mathematically that line joining midpoint of two sides of triangle is parallel to third side</s>
<|assistant|>
Let ABC be a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, where the midpoints of sides AB and BC are D and E, respectively. We need to prove that the line passing through D and E is parallel to side AC.

Let's draw the perpendicular bisectors of sides AB and BC, meeting at the point O. Since O is the midpoint of both AB and BC, we know that AD = DB = OD, and similarly, EC = CE = OC.

Now, let's draw the line DE, which is perpendicular to both AD and EC, and meets AB and BC at F and G, respectively. We know that F and G are also the midpoints of the corresponding halves of AB and BC, respectively.

Let's draw the line DE extended to meet side AC at H. We need to prove that CH is parallel to AC.

First, we can see that CH is perpendicular to AC, since DE is perpendicular to both AD and EC, and CH is an extension of DE.

Next, we'll prove that CH is congruent to AC. Let's draw the perpendicular bisector of CH, which meets CH at I. Since CH is perpendicular to AC, we know that I is also on AC, and we can see that I is the midpoint of AC.

Since CH is perpendicular to AC and congruent to AC, we know that CH is also the height of the triangle ACH, which is half the height of the triangle ABC. Since the height of a triangle is perpendicular to the base and bisects the base, we know that CH is parallel to AC.

Therefore, we have proved that the line passing through the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side.

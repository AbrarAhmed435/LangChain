Prove mathematically that line joining midpoint of two sides of triangle is parallel to third side</s>
<|assistant|>
Let the midpoint of the two sides of a triangle be $P$ and $Q$.

Suppose that the line joining the midpoints of the two sides is parallel to the third side. Then, the line joining $P$ and $Q$ is also parallel to the third side. 

Let $R$ be the third side of the triangle, and let $O$ be any point on $R$.

Then,

1. $R = P

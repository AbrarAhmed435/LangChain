Prove mathematically that line joining midpoint of two sides of triangle is parallel to third side</s>
<|assistant|>
Let ABC be a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c opposite vertices A, B, and C, respectively. Let M be the midpoint of side AB, and N be the midpoint of side AC.

To prove that the line joining M and N is parallel to the third side BC, we need to show that the slopes of the lines joining M and C, and N and B are equal.

Let us find the coordinates of C and B. Let

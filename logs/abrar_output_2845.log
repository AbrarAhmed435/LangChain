Prove mathematically that line joining midpoint of two sides of triangle is parallel to third side</s>
<|assistant|>
Let ABC be a triangle with sides AB, BC, and AC. Let M be the midpoint of side AB and N be the midpoint of side BC.

To prove that the line joining M and N is parallel to side AC, we need to show that the slopes of the lines joining vertices A, M, and N with vertex C are equal.

Let's first find the coordinates of M and N. Since M is the midpoint of AB, we have:

M = (1/2) * (x_a, y_a) + (1/2) * (x_b, y_b)

M = ((x_a + x_b) / 2, (y_a + y_b) / 2)

Similarly, since N is the midpoint of BC, we have:

N = (1/2) * (x_b, y_b) + (1/2) * (x_c, y_c)

N = ((x_b + x_c) / 2, (y_b + y_c) / 2)

Now, let's find the slopes of the lines AM, AN, and AC.

The slope of AM is:

(y_c - y_a) / (x_c - x_a)

The slope of AN is:

(y_c - y_b) / (x_c - x_b)

The slope of AC is:

(y_c - y_a) / (x_c - x_a)

Since the slopes of AM and AN are equal, we have:

(y_c - y_a) / (x_c - x_a) = (y_c - y_b) / (x_c - x_b)

Multiplying both sides by (x_c - x_a), we get:

(y_c - y_a) * (x_c - x_b) = (y_c - y_b) * (x_c - x_a)

Subtracting (y_c - y_b) * (x_c - x_a) from both sides, we get:

(y_c - y_a) * (x_c - x_b) - (y_c - y_b) * (x_c - x_a) = 0

This is the formula for the cross product of two vectors. Since the cross product of two collinear vectors is zero, this implies that the vectors (x_c - x_a, y_c - y_a) and (x_c - x_b, y_c - y_b) are collinear. This further implies that the lines joining vertices A, M, and C with vertex C are parallel to the line joining vertices B, N, and C.

Therefore, the line joining midpoints M and N is parallel to side AC.
